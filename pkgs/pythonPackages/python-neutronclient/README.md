This package is generated by `pypi2nix`. There is an issue with
`unittest2` that makes the process more complicated than usual...

First, we have to get the `requirements.txt` from the
`python-neutronclient` repository. We then have to add a patched `unittest2`
version.

then, we can run pypi2nix:

```
pypi2nix -V 2.7 \
    -r requirements.txt \
    --setup-requires traceback2 \
    --setup-requires six \
    --setup-requires pbr \
    --setup-requires argparse \
    -e python-neutronclient==6.9.0 \
    -e argparse -e setuptools_scm
```
